## 🚀 Comprehensive Credit Risk Assessment Framework: A Machine Learning Approach to Loan Default Prediction
### Project Overview

This project implements a robust machine learning framework for predicting loan default (credit risk) using the lending_data.csv dataset. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies high-risk loans to mitigate financial losses for the lending institution.

### The framework consists of two primary machine learning tasks:

Regression Task (Borrower Income Prediction): Training a model to estimate borrower_income as an intermediate feature.

Classification Task (Loan Default Prediction): Training and evaluating various classifiers to predict the binary loan_status (0: Healthy Loan, 1: High-Risk Loan/Default).
